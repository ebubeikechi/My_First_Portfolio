                    I’m a Settlement and Reconciliation Specialist with expertise in office automation. My experience in the fintech space has been shaped by building tools and systems that ensure accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in financial operations. I focus on automating settlement processes, developing reconciliation solutions that eliminate discrepancies, and reducing manual workload through Excel automation and custom-built applications
                    With a background in Mathematics and Statistics, I bring analytical precision to every project, whether it’s building software, solving operational puzzles, or automating reporting workflows. Outside of tech, I express my creativity as a pianist—proof that logic and rhythm can coexist beautifully.
